# **Kickstarting with Excel**

## **Overview of Project**

### *Purpose*
The purpose of the projest is to use scenario that would require data analysis and visualization to familiarize one's 
self with how first to approach a new experience. Like in the Kickstarter dataset, acting as data analysts, we had to
first size up and get a feel of what we were going to be working on by finding out how many columns and rows the data
has, what type of data we are working on, whether the data was readable or requires converting in some way.'

## **Analysis and Challenges**
I first of all I tried analyzing the size of the Kickstarter dataset by finding out how many columns and rows it has. With
the use of CTRL + right arrow shortcut to see the last column, and CTRL + down arrow shortcut to see the rows of the 
dataset. I encountered some challenges like realizing that some cells requires filtering, formatting or freezing so as
to be accomplish this activity.

### **Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date**
By analyzing the data based on lunch date, I was able to see from the graph (Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png) that the 
month of May was the month that launched the most succesful Kickstarter campaigns. Also, from the graph, January, June,
July, and October all had closely the same amount of failed campaigns launched.

### **Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals**
With the outcomes based on goals analysis, using the COUNTIFS excel function, I was able to see at which goal ranges,
filtering plays as used on the challenge, I can see at what goal range the project was succesful more, or at what range
it failed the most, and this will help to know where best to put more effort in the future. 

### **Challenges and Difficulties Encountered**
Being new to the world of coding, I encountered some challenges. First I learnt the dard way that typing a character in
error can make your life miserable. It was also a good way to learn because being up all these long hours late at night
has been very helpful. The coding terms and formulas again are all new, but I am geting there.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
